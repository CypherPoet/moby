Moby is a simple app that lets you download and test AHAP (Apple Haptic and Audio Pattern) files.
Please note that `CoreHaptics` is only avaialble in iOS 13, so make sure to run this with Xcode 11.
You can use our [Catain AHAP](https://ahap.fancypixel.it/) web app to design your own haptic files graphically:
